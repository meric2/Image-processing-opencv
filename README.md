# Image processing with openCV
This repository contains the implementations of some openCV methods in Python to process and filter an image through the codes I wrote in image processing course. The codes openly shows what the algorithm actually does within the loops. The proper usage of openCV functions are also utilized for result comparison.  

## Overview

This repository includes the implementations of:

- Adaptive Filters  
- Bilateral Filter
- Box Filter  
- CLAHE  
- Histogram Equalization  
- Median Filter
